# koss-compilers-task
- I have made my own programming language and its compiler.
- It can only print statements.
## Syntax
```
print "Hello World!!"
```
### Output:
```
> Hello World!!
```
## the absurd part is that u can even do something like this
```
hello world can u print this statement "Hello World!!!" insanee thx.
```
### Output:
```
> Hello World!!!
```
